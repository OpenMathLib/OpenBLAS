02-Dec-2018

common:
	* the new, experimental thread-local memory allocation had 
	  inadvertently been left enabled for gmake builds in 0.3.3
	  despite the announcement. It is now disabled by default, and

	  if the USE_TLS option is turned on.
	* OpenBLAS will now provide enough buffer space for at least 50
	  threads by default.
	* The output of openblas_get_config() now contains the version
	  number.

	* The code will now automatically call blas_thread_init after a
	  fork if needed before handling a call to openblas_set_num_threads
	* Accesses to parallelized level3 functions from multiple callers
	  are now serialized to avoid thread races (unless using OpenMP).
	  This should provide better performance than the known-threadsafe
	  (but non-default) USE_SIMPLE_THREADED_LEVEL3 option.
	* When building LAPACK with gfortran, -frecursive is now (again)
	  enabled by default to ensure correct behaviour.
        * The OpenBLAS version cblas.h now supports both CBLAS_ORDER and
	  CBLAS_LAYOUT as the name of the matrix row/column order option.
	* Externally set LDFLAGS are now passed through to the final compile/link
	  steps to facilitate setting platform-specific linker flags.
	* A potential race condition during the build of LAPACK (that would 
	  usually manifest itself as a failure to build TESTING/MATGEN) has been 
	  fixed.
	* xHEMV has been changed to stay single-threaded for small input sizes
	  where the overhead of multithreading exceeds any possible gains
	* CSWAP and ZSWAP have been limited to a single thread except on ARMV8 or
	  ThunderX hardware with sizable input.
	* Linker flags for the PGI compiler have been updated
	* Behaviour of AXPY with zero increments is now handled in the C interface,
	  correcting the result on at least Intel Atom.
	* The result matrix from calling SGELSS with an all-zero input matrix is 
	  now zeroed completely.
	  
x86_64:
	* Autodetection of AMD Ryzen2 has been fixed (again).
        * CMAKE builds now support labeling of an INTERFACE64=1 build of

	* DYNAMic_ARCH support is now available for 64bit ARM
	* cross-compiling for ARMV8 under iOS now works.
	* cpu-specific code has been rearranged to make better use of both
	  hardware commonalities and model-specific compiler optimizations.
	* XGENE1 has been removed as a TARGET, superseded by the improved generic
	  ARMV8 support.
	
ARMV7:
	* Older assembly mnemonics have been converted to UAL form to allow
	  building with clang 7.0
	* Cross compiling LAPACKE for Android has been fixed again (broken by
	  update to LAPACK 3.7.0 some while ago).  
	  
====================================================================
Version 0.3.3
31-Aug-2018

common:
	* thread memory allocation has been switched back to the method
	  used before version 0.3.1 due to unexpected problems caused by
	  the new code under some circumstances. A new compile-time option
	  USE_TLS has been added to enable the new code, and it is hoped
	  that this can become the default again in the next version.
	* LAPAck PR272 has been integrated, which fixes spurious errors
	  in DSYEVR and related functions caused by missing conversion 
	  from ILAENV to ILAENV_2STAGE in several _2stage routines.

	* Fixed a building bug when DYNAMIC_ARCH=1 & INTERFACE64=1.
	  (Refs issue #44 on github)

====================================================================
Version 0.1 alpha2.1

common:
	* Stop the build and output the error message when detecting
	  fortran compiler failed. (Refs issue #42 on github)

====================================================================
Version 0.1 alpha2
23-Jun-2011

common:
	* Fixed blasint undefined bug in <cblas.h> file. Other software
	  could include this header successfully(Refs issue #13 on github)
	* Fixed the SEGFAULT bug on 64 cores. On SMP server, the number
	  of CPUs or cores should be less than or equal to 64.(Refs issue #14
	  on github)
	* Support "void goto_set_num_threads(int num_threads)" and "void
	  openblas_set_num_threads(int num_threads)" when USE_OPENMP=1
	* Added extern "C" to support C++. Thank Tasio for the patch(Refs
	  issue #21 on github)
	* Provided an error message when the arch is not supported.(Refs
	  issue #19 on github)
	* Fixed issue #23. Fixed a bug of f_check script about generating link flags.
	* Added openblas_set_num_threads for Fortran.
	* Fixed #25 a wrong result of rotmg.
	* Fixed a bug about detecting underscore prefix in c_check.
	* Print the wall time (cycles) with enabling FUNCTION_PROFILE
	* Fixed #35 a build bug with NO_LAPACK=1 & DYNAMIC_ARCH=1
	* Added install target. You can use "make install". (Refs #20)


x86/x86_64:
	* Fixed #28 a wrong result of dsdot on x86_64.
	* Fixed #32 a SEGFAULT bug of zdotc with gcc-4.6.
	* Fixed #33 ztrmm bug on Nehalem.
	* Work-around #27 the low performance axpy issue with small imput size & multithreads.

MIPS64:
	* Fixed #28 a wrong result of dsdot on Loongson3A/MIPS64.
	* Optimized single/double precision BLAS Level3 on Loongson3A/MIPS64. (Refs #2)
	* Optimized single/double precision axpy function on Loongson3A/MIPS64. (Refs #3)

====================================================================
Version 0.1 alpha1
20-Mar-2011

common:
	* Support "make  NO_LAPACK=1" to build the library without
	  LAPACK functions.
	* Fixed randomly SEGFAULT when nodemask==NULL with above Linux 2.6.34.
	  Thank Mr.Ei-ji Nakama providing this patch. (Refs issue #12 on github)
	* Added DEBUG=1 rule in Makefile.rule to build debug version.
	* Disable compiling quad precision in reference BLAS library(netlib BLAS).
	* Added unit testcases in utest/ subdir. Used  CUnit framework.
	* Supported OPENBLAS_* & GOTO_* environment variables (Pleas see README)
	* Imported GotoBLAS2 1.13 BSD version

x86/x86_64:
	* On x86 32bits, fixed a bug in zdot_sse2.S line 191. This would casue
	  zdotu & zdotc failures. Instead, work-around it. (Refs issue #8 #9 on github)
	* Modified ?axpy functions to return same netlib BLAS results
	  when incx==0 or incy==0 (Refs issue #7 on github)
	* Modified ?swap functions to return same netlib BLAS results
	  when incx==0 or incy==0 (Refs issue #6 on github)
	* Modified ?rot functions to return same netlib BLAS results
	  when incx==0 or incy==0 (Refs issue #4 on github)
	* Detect Intel Westmere,Intel Clarkdale and Intel Arrandale
	  to use Nehalem codes.
	* Fixed a typo bug about compiling dynamic ARCH library.
MIPS64:
	* Improve daxpy performance on ICT Loongson 3A.
	* Supported ICT Loongson 3A CPU (Refs issue #1 on github)
