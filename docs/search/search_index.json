For efficiency, the management array structure for these buffers is sized at build time - this makes it necessary to know in advance how many threads need to be supported on the target system(s).  With OpenMP, there is an additional level of complexity as there may be calls originating from a parallel region in the calling program. If OpenBLAS gets called from a single parallel region, it runs single-threaded automatically to avoid overloading the system by fanning out its own set of threads.  In the case that an OpenMP program makes multiple calls from independent regions or instances in parallel, this default serialization is not sufficient as the additional caller(s) would compete for the original set of buffers already in use by the first call. So if multiple OpenMP runtimes call into OpenBLAS at the same time, then only one of them will be able to make progress while all the rest of them spin-wait for the one available buffer. Setting NUM_PARALLEL to the upper bound on the number of OpenMP runtimes that you can have in a process ensures that there are a sufficient number of buffer sets available</p>"},{"location":"ci/","title":"CI jobs","text":"Arch Target CPU OS Build system XComp to C Compiler Fortran Compiler threading DYN_ARCH INT64 Libraries CI Provider CPU  count x86_64 Intel 32bit Windows CMAKE/VS2015 -

These recommendations are aimed at general packaging systems, with a user base that typically is large, open source (or freely available at least), and doesn't behave uniformly or that the packager is directly connected with.*</p> <p>OpenBLAS has a large number of build-time options which can be used to change how it behaves at runtime, how artifacts or symbols are named, etc. Variation in build configuration can be necessary to acheive a given end goal within a distribution or as an end user. However, such variation can also make it more difficult to build on top of OpenBLAS and ship code or other packages in a way that works across many different distros. Here we provide guidance about the most important build options, what effects they may have when changed, and which ones to default to.</p> <p>The Make and CMake build systems provide equivalent options and yield more or less the same artifacts, but not exactly (the CMake builds are still experimental). You can choose either one and the options will function in the same way, however the CMake outputs may require some renaming. To review available build options, see <code>Makefile.rule</code> or <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> in the root of the repository.</p> <p>Build options typically fall into two categories: (a) options that affect the user interface, such as library and symbol names or APIs that are made available, and (b) options that affect performance and runtime behavior, such as threading behavior or CPU architecture-specific code paths. The user interface options are more important to keep aligned between distributions, while for the performance-related options there are typically more reasons to make choices that deviate from the defaults.</p> <p>Here are recommendations for user interface related packaging choices where it is not likely to be a good idea to deviate (typically these are the default settings):</p> <ol> <li>Include CBLAS. The CBLAS interface is widely used and it doesn't affect    binary size much, so don't turn it off.</li> <li>Include LAPACK and LAPACKE. The LAPACK interface is also widely used, and    while it does make up a significant part of the binary size of the installed    library, that does not outweigh the regression in usability when deviating    from the default here.[^1]</li> <li>Always distribute the pkg-config (<code>.pc</code>) and CMake <code>.cmake</code>) dependency    detection files. These files are used by build systems when users want to    link against OpenBLAS, and there is no benefit of leaving them out.</li> <li>Provide the LP64 interface by default, and if in addition to that you choose    to provide an ILP64 interface build as well, use a symbol suffix to avoid    symbol name clashes (see the next section).</li> </ol> <p>[^1] All major distributions do include LAPACK as of mid 2023 as far as we know.

As of today there is an agreed-upon way of choosing names for OpenBLAS between a number of key users/redistributors, which is the closest thing to a standard that there is now. However, there is an ongoing standardization effort in the reference BLAS and LAPACK libraries, which differs from the current OpenBLAS agreed-upon convention. In this section we'll aim to explain both.</p> <p>Those two methods are fairly similar, and have a key thing in common: using a symbol suffix. This is good practice; it is recommended that if you distribute an ILP64 build, to have it use a symbol suffix containing <code>64</code> in the name.
